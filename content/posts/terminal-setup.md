# Terminals (+ Ghostty Setup)

Lately, I‚Äôve been filling in some of the gaps in my software engineering knowledge. One random question that I had was this little message in my Terminal:

```bash
Last login: Sat Apr 19 00:15:16 on ttys001
```

What does *ttys001* even mean?

## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal, Console, TTY ‚Äî What's the Difference?

That question led me to explore how terminals actually work. I had always used the default Terminal app on macOS without giving it much thought. Now I know:

- **Shell**: A shell is a program that acts as a command-line interface  etween you and the operating system.
- **Terminal**: The application that lets you interact with the shell.
- **Console**: The physical device or main terminal (originally tied to mainframes).
- **TTY (Teletypewriter)**: A legacy term that still shows up in Unix systems to refer to terminal devices.

## Enter: Ghostty

After browsing terminal emulators available in 2025, I decided to switch to **Ghostty**. I checked out other great ones like **Kitty**, **wezterm**, and **alacritty**. I also looked into **Warp**, but requiring a login to collect telemetry made it a no-go for me.

I chose Ghostty because:

- It‚Äôs fast ‚Äî significantly faster than the stock Terminal app (some benchmarks say *10x* faster).
- It‚Äôs standards-compliant.
- It has a bunch of quality-of-life features, like themes, tab/split management, and Kitty graphics protocol support.

I‚Äôm still new to terminal emulators, so honestly, any of the modern ones would‚Äôve blown my mind. But the Ghostty experience, especially how easy it is to apply pretty themes, see the terminal inspector - won me. Other features I am now using are windows, tabs, and splits, whereas I used to go have different tabs only. Also the Kitty graphics protocol.

## ‚ú® My Shell Config (with Starship)

I use `Starship` for my prompt and my shell is `zsh`:

```toml
# Wait 15 sec for starship to check files under the current working directory
scan_timeout = 15

# Disable the blank line at the start of the prompt
add_newline = false

# Replace the "‚ùØ" symbol in the prompt with "‚ûú"
[character]
success_symbol = "[‚ûú](bold green)"
error_symbol = "[‚úñ](bold red)"

[username]
format = " [‚ï≠‚îÄ$user]($style)@"
style_user = "bold red"
style_root = "bold red"
show_always = true

[hostname]
format = "[$hostname]($style) in "
style = "bold dimmed red"
trim_at = "-"
ssh_only = false
disabled = false

[directory]
style = "purple"
truncation_length = 0
truncate_to_repo = true
truncation_symbol = "repo: "

[git_status]
style = "white"

[cmd_duration]
min_time = 1
format = "took [$duration]($style)"
disabled = false

[golang]
style = "bg:#86BBD8"
format = 'via [ $symbol ($version) ]($style)'

[docker_context]
style = "bg:#06969A"
format = '[ $symbol $context ]($style)$path'

[git_commit]
disabled = false
commit_hash_length = 8

[kubernetes]
symbol = "‚éà "
```
